So let's make a plain vanilla JS string templating engine. Once you know the core concepts, you can use whatever library that you want. Basically, I'm writing my own templating engine here for simplicity, illustrative purposes & speed of code execution. -->

			<!-- JS Libraries -->

			<!-- The problem with installing libraries into /js/ is that whenever we need to search for something in a .js file, it will scan hundreds of /js/libs/*.js files. 
				There usually isn't an easy way to exclude those from search filters in HTML Editors. So it's better to create a /libs/ folder structure, which can house these files: /libs/libraryName/version_Major.minor.release/libraryName.min.js file. It's logical & this makes it easy to delete folders, whenever new versions of each library are released.
